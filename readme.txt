I'm working on this project currently, its nowhere near done but feel free to take a look so far if you like.

This code is 100% credit to the MathWorks organization, the makers of Matlab.  This is a reproduction of the code found at:

I've only made minor changes to make the MathWorks example to make it compatible with Octave 4.0.0.
